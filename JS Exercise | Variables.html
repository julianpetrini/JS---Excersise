The Fortune Teller
Why pay a fortune teller when you can just program your fortune yourself?

Store the following into variables: number of children, partner's name, geographic location, job title.
Output your fortune to the screen like so: "You will be a X in Y, and married to Z with N kids."-->
<script>
    //EX n1
    let childrenNumber=2;
    let partnersName="Tu";
    let geoLoc="Switzerland";
    let jobTit="Web developer";

    let future = "You will have " + childrenNumber + " childs and will marry " + partnersName + " and will live happy in " + geoLoc + " and work as a " +jobTit; 

    console.log(future);

    //EX n2
    let bYear=1987;
    let fYear=2032;

    let fAge=fYear-bYear;
    let fAge2=fYear-bYear-1;

    let ageCalculator = "I will be " + fAge + " or " + fAge2 + " in the year " + fYear + " because i was born in " + bYear;
